# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

## About this project:
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means youâ€™re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.
A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works.
In this project, I was asked to explain what happens when you type `google.com` in your browser and press `Enter`.
I wrote a blog post answering this classic question - explaining how different components of a networking stack
work together to render a web page. I also put together a diagram to visualize the networking process.
In my explanation, I covered the following concepts:
- DNS request
- TCP/IP
- Firewall
- HTTPS/SSL
- Load-balancer
- Web server
- Application server
- Database
